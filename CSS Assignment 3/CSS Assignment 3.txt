Q1: Why is it called a pseudo-class?
Answer: A "pseudo-class" is named as such because it is not a real class in the traditional sense of HTML and CSS. Instead, it is a special keyword that allows you to style elements based on certain states or conditions that cannot be represented by regular classes or IDs. For example, ':hover' is a pseudo-class that allows you to style an element when a user hovers over it with their mouse. Similarly, ':focus' styles an element when it has keyboard focus, and ':first-child' styles an element that is the first child of its parent.

Q2: What are gradients in CSS?
Answer: Gradients in CSS are like smoothly blending colors together on a webpage. They create a gradual shift from one color to another, making things look nicer. You can use gradients to give elements like buttons or boxes a stylish, modern appearance by adding depth and a cool visual effect to their backgrounds or borders.
