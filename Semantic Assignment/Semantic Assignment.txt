Q1: What are the new things introduced in HTML5?
Answer: HTML5 brought a lot of new and exciting changes to how we build websites. It introduced new tags like <header>, <footer>, and <section> to help structure your content better. Now, you can easily embed audio and video directly with <audio> and <video> tags, so you don't need extra plugins. For graphics, HTML5 includes the <canvas> tag for drawing and <svg> for scalable vector images. Forms also got a big upgrade. There are new input types like 'date,' 'email,' 'URL,' and 'number,' which make it easier to get the right kind of data from users. Plus, new attributes like 'placeholder' and 'required' improve how forms work and feel.

Q2: What are semantic tags? Give a couple of examples.
Answer: Semantic tags in HTML are like labels that tell you what the content inside them is all about. Instead of just using generic tags like <div>, which don't tell you anything about the content, semantic tags give meaning to the content. For example, <header> is used for the top section of a page, like a title or navigation links. <article> is for a piece of content that stands alone, like a blog post. These tags make the code easier to understand for everyone, including search engines and screen readers, improving SEO and accessibility.

Q3: List some uses of semantic tags.
Answer: Semantic tags in HTML are really handy because they make your code easier to read and understand, both for humans and search engines. This helps improve your website’s search rankings. They also make your site more accessible to people using screen readers, which is great for inclusivity. Plus, using semantic tags means your code is cleaner and more organized, so it’s easier to work on and maintain. Some common semantic tags are <header>, <nav>, <section>, <article>, <aside>, and <footer>.
