Q1: Why do we start learning a programming language with "Hello, World!"?
Answer: Starting with "Hello, World!" when learning a programming language is like learning the ABCs before diving into reading books. It's the first step that introduces you to the basic building blocks of writing code. By creating a simple program that prints "Hello, World!" on the screen, beginners get a feel for how the language works—how to structure commands, handle syntax, and see immediate results. It's also a tradition in programming tutorials because it's straightforward yet essential. This small achievement boosts confidence and motivates learners to explore further.

Q2: How is the use of comments and how do you write comments in HTML?
Answer: Comments in HTML are like sticky notes for developers. They're bits of text you can write directly into your code to explain what's going on. When you write a comment in HTML, it won't show up on the actual webpage—it's just there for anyone reading the code. To write a comment in HTML, you use <!-- to start the comment and --> to end it. Anything in between these markers is ignored by the browser.

Q3: What are elements, tags, and attributes, and the difference between them.
Answer: 1) Elements: Think of elements as the basic building blocks of a webpage. Each element represents a different part of the content, like a paragraph (<p>), an image (<img>), or a link (<a>).
2) Tags: Tags are like labels that define where each element begins and ends. They're always enclosed in angle brackets (<>). For example, <p> starts a paragraph, and </p> ends it.
3) Attributes: Attributes give extra information about an element. They're added to the opening tag and provide details that aren't part of the visible content. For instance, the href="https://example.com" attribute in an <a> tag tells the browser where to go when the link is clicked.

Difference:
1) Elements are the whole package, including tags, content, and attributes.
2) Tags are the markers that define the beginning and end of an element's content.
3) Attributes provide extra details about an element, like links or image sources.

Q4: Briefly explain what HTML entities are.
Answer: HTML entities are codes used to represent special characters in HTML that have specific meanings or are difficult to type directly. These codes start with & and end with ;. They are used to display characters like <, >, & in web pages. HTML entities ensure that these characters appear correctly across different browsers and devices, helping maintain consistency in how content is displayed on the web.
