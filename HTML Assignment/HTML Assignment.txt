Q1: What are inline and block elements in HTML and the difference between them? Name a few inline elements and block elements.
Answer: Inline elements in HTML are like words in a sentence; they fit right in with the surrounding text without starting on a new line. Examples of inline elements include <span> (used for styling small bits of text), <a> (links), <img> (images within text), <strong> (bold text), and <em> (italicized text). Block elements, on the other hand, are like paragraphs in a book; they start on a new line and take up the full width available. Examples of block elements are <div> (a container for other elements), <p> (paragraphs), <h1>, <h2>, etc. (headings), <ul> (lists), and <li> (list items). The main difference between inline and block elements is how they behave in the document layout. Inline elements stay within the line of text, while block elements start on a new line and stretch across the page.

Q2: How to work with images in HTML and explain in detail ‹img /› tag important attributes.
Answer: In HTML, you use the <img /> tag to add images to your web pages. This tag doesn't need a closing tag. To display an image, you use the src attribute to specify the image file's path. For example: <img src="path/to/image.jpg" alt="A beautiful scenery">. The alt attribute is really important because it provides a description of the image. This description shows up if the image can't load and helps screen readers describe the image to visually impaired users. You can also control the image size with the width and height attributes. These set the image's width and height in pixels, like this: <img src="path/to/image.jpg" alt="A beautiful scenery" width="600" height="400">. The title attribute adds a tooltip that appears when you hover over the image, providing extra info. For example: <img src="path/to/image.jpg" alt="A beautiful scenery" title="Beautiful scenery in the mountains">.

Q3: How to create lists in HTML?
Answer: To create an unordered list, use <ul> with <li> for each item, displaying with bullet points. Example: <ul><li>Item 1</li><li>Item 2</li><li>Item 3</li></ul>. For ordered lists, use <ol> with <li> for each item, displaying with numbers or letters. Example: <ol><li>First item</li><li>Second item</li><li>Third item</li></ol>. To define terms and their descriptions, use <dl> for the list, <dt> for terms, and <dd> for their descriptions. Example: <dl><dt>HTML</dt><dd>HyperText Markup Language</dd><dt>CSS</dt><dd>Cascading Style Sheets</dd></dl>.

Q4: How to interlink web pages and navigate people to other websites?
Answer: To link to another page within our own website, specify the relative path to the target page using the href attribute. For example, if you have a page named about.html in the same directory, <a href="about.html">About Us</a> creates a link titled "About Us". Clicking on this link will take users to the about.html page. When directing users to external websites, use the <a> tag with an absolute URL in the href attribute. For example, <a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank">Visit Example Website</a> creates a link titled "Visit Example Website". Clicking on this link will open https://www.example.com in a new browser tab due to the target="_blank" attribute.
