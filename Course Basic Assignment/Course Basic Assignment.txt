Q1: What is HTML?
Answer: HTML is like the skeleton of a webpageâ€”it's what gives structure to all the content you see online. You use it to create headings, paragraphs, links, images, and much more. Basically, it's the language that web browsers understand to display everything correctly. It's essential for building any kind of website or web application.

Q2: What is CSS?
Answer: CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is like the fashion designer for web pages. It's used to control how HTML elements are displayed on a webpage. While HTML defines the structure and content of a webpage (like saying "this is a heading" or "this is a paragraph"), CSS determines how those elements look (such as setting colors, fonts, margins, and layout). For example, CSS can make text bigger, change its color, position elements on the page, create animations, and make the webpage look more visually appealing overall.

Q3: Why did JavaScript come into the picture?
Answer: JavaScript came into the picture to make websites more dynamic and interactive. In the early days of the web, HTML and CSS were primarily used to create static web pages that displayed information and basic styling. However, there was a need for more functionality and interactivity, such as creating animations, updating content dynamically without refreshing the entire page, and responding to user actions in real-time.

Q4: History of JavaScript and EcmaScript. Explain in your own words.
JavaScript was first developed by Netscape in the mid-1990s to make web pages more interactive. It became popular because it allowed developers to do things on websites that HTML alone couldn't handle, like changing elements on a page or responding to clicks and inputs from users. As JavaScript grew in use, it needed to be standardized so that it would work consistently across different web browsers and platforms. Ecma International, an organization that sets standards for technology, took on the task of standardizing JavaScript. They called the standardized version ECMAScript, which is named after the organization (Ecma) overseeing its development. Over the years, ECMAScript has gone through several updates, each one bringing new features and improvements to JavaScript. For example, ECMAScript 3, released in 1999, introduced foundational features that browsers widely adopted at the time. These updates have helped JavaScript evolve into a powerful language for creating dynamic and interactive web applications.
