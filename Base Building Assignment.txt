Q1: What is the Internet? Explain in your own words.
Answer: The Internet is like a giant web that connects millions of computers all over the world. Imagine it as a massive, invisible network that lets people share information and communicate with each other instantly. When you go online to look up something, send an email, or chat with a friend, you're using this network. Think of it as a huge library that never closes, where you can find almost any information you need, and a giant post office that delivers messages in the blink of an eye. It's also like a big, global playground where people can share pictures, videos, and ideas, or play games together, even if they're on opposite sides of the planet.

Q2: What is a web browser? Explain in your own words.
Answer: A web browser is a tool or app that lets you explore the Internet. Think of it as your gateway or window to the online world. When you want to visit a website, you open your web browser and type in the address or click on a link. The browser then fetches the web page and displays it for you to see and interact with. Popular web browsers include Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. They help you read articles, watch videos, shop online, and do many other activities on the Internet easily and quickly. In simple terms, a web browser is like your vehicle for traveling around the Internet.

Q3: What is a browser engine? Explain in your own words.
Answer: A browser engine is like the brain of a web browser. It's the part of the browser that takes the code behind a web page and turns it into what you see on your screen. When you visit a website, the browser engine reads the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code and figures out how to display the text, images, and layout correctly. It makes sure that everything looks and works the way it's supposed to. In simple terms, if the web browser is the car you drive around the Internet, the browser engine is the engine under the hood that makes it all run smoothly.

Q4: What is a static site? Explain in your own words.
Answer: A static site is a website with content that doesn't change unless someone manually updates it. Think of it like a printed book: once it's published, the words and pictures stay the same until a new edition is printed. For example, a static site could be a personal blog or a business website that provides information about products and services. The pages are built using HTML, CSS, and sometimes a little JavaScript, and they show the same content to every visitor. In contrast to dynamic sites, which can update automatically and show different information based on user interactions, static sites are simpler and often faster because the content is fixed and doesn't need to be generated on the fly.

Q5: What is a dynamic site? Explain in your own words.
Answer: A dynamic site is a website that can change its content automatically based on user interactions or other factors. It's more like a conversation than a printed book because it can respond and adapt to what you do. For example, social media sites, news websites, and online stores are dynamic sites. When you log in, you see personalised content like your friendâ€™s posts, the latest headlines, or product recommendations based on your previous purchases. The pages are built using technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and server-side programming languages (like PHP or Python), which work together to create and update the content in real-time. In simple terms, a dynamic site is interactive and flexible, providing a unique experience for each visitor by constantly updating its content.
