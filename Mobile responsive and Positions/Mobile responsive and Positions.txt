Q1: What are media queries in CSS and their use case?
Answer: Media queries in CSS are like instructions that check what device someone is using to view a website. They help make websites look good on any device by changing how things are laid out or styled based on the screen size. For example, they can make text bigger on a phone screen or rearrange menus so they're easier to use on a tablet. Media queries ensure websites are easy to read and use on different devices.

Q2: Difference between min-width and max-width in media queries in CSS.
Answer: 'min-width' specifies the minimum width at which styles should apply. If the viewport width is equal to or greater than this value, the styles inside the media query will be applied. 'max-width', on the other hand, specifies the maximum width at which styles should apply. If the viewport width is equal to or less than this value, the styles inside the media query will be applied.

Q3: Explain float property and clear property in CSS with examples.
Answer: Float Property: The float property in CSS is used to move an element to the left or right within its container. It was commonly used in the past for creating layouts where elements could sit next to each other, like images alongside text.
Clear Property: The clear property controls how elements behave around floated elements. It determines whether an element should move below any floated elements that come before it in the HTML structure. This is useful for ensuring elements don't accidentally overlap or get stuck next to floated content.
