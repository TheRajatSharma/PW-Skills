Q1: What is Emmet?
Answer: Emmet is like a fast lane for web developers. It's a tool that lets you write HTML and CSS code much faster by using shortcuts called "Emmet abbreviations." Instead of typing out full tags and structures, you use these abbreviations and Emmet expands them into complete code snippets. For example, if you type ul>li*5 and then use Emmet, it quickly turns into a full list with five list items (<ul><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul>). It's a big time-saver, especially for creating repetitive structures or complex layouts in HTML and CSS. Emmet helps developers work more efficiently, focusing more on building and less on typing out every single tag and class.

Q2: What are the advantages of using Emmet
Answer: It allows you to write HTML and CSS code quickly using simple abbreviations and shortcuts. This saves time compared to manually typing out every tag and class. By generating code automatically, Emmet reduces the chances of syntax errors and typos that can occur with manual typing. This helps maintain cleaner and more reliable code. Emmet is compatible with various editors and IDEs, making it accessible to developers using different tools. This allows developers to use Emmet across different projects and environments.
